# Sudoku-Solver
Sudoku is a game played on a 9x9 grid where every single square is filled with a number from 1 to 9 unique to its row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. This is a program that takes unsolved sudoku from the user and prints out solved sudoku on to the console.This program is completely built in Java.
# personal motivation
sudoku is a very favourite game puzzle of mine.After I took an intro to programming course in my first year of university, one of my first personal projects was a solution generator in C. I still remember the feelings of excitement and enjoyment that I felt. Now after learning Java I wanted to build a small project that will boost  my confidence to build many more in future.so I decided to build one on my favourite game puzzle.The algorithm design is like the puzzle to me.I always want to try to come up with things on my own before looking at how other people do things. Perhaps in doing so, I will come up with something new, and maybe even something that is better in some ways than existing approaches.
